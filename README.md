## Description
Phantomcatcher allows you to protect some area from phantom spawning. No more annoying phantoms at your base and no more sleeping needed. 

Works like Lightning Rod but protects from Phantoms

<details>
<summary>Why it's good to use</summary>

- You can use cats. But it doesn't prevent Phantom spawning.

- You can turn off Phantom spawning by setting ```doInsomina``` gamerule to ```false```. But in some cases you need to farm Phantom Membranes.
- You can prevent phantom spawning by sleeping. But it may not work on a server.
- You can build glass roof above your base. But it can look terrible and be not comfortable if you use elytra to fly above your base.

Phantomcatcher doesn't have any of this problem. You just place it anywhere. You can even hide it.

Phantomcatcher can't catch Phantoms untill it fully charged. It charges for 3 game days (1 real hour) \
